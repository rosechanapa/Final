# Exam Grading System
The Exam Grading System is designed to automate the process of grading exams, specifically paper-based exams. The system allows for the scanning and analysis of exam papers, and it can handle different formats of answers, including multiple-choice, short answer, and essay-type questions. This system utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to identify and grade handwritten answers, streamlining the grading process and providing accurate, real-time results.
